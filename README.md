# MLB-Pitcher-Clusters
This project uses KMeans to create clusters for MLB pitchers.  I used cbssports for my data source and came up with the following clusters:

Cluster 0 - ERA very high, strikeouts very low
Cluster 1 - ERA moderately high, strikeouts low
Cluster 2 - ERA very low, strikeouts very high (This group would include what would be considered ace pitchers.)
Cluster 3 - ERA moderately low, strikeouts high
Cluster 4 - ERA high, strikeouts high
